# BST-Implementation-on-College-Courses

Stores Courses in a .txt file in a Binary Search Tree data structure.

When testing, be sure to insert the path for Courses.txt in line 234 of main.cpp.



The code developed in the file aims to solve the problem of managing and searching for information about courses and their prerequisites. The program reads course data from a file and stores it in an appropriate data structure that provides a way to search for a specific course using its course number to print out the course information and its prerequisites.

I approached the problem of creating such a program systematically by first drafting the pseudocode to define data structures, read data from a file, parse the data, and check for file format errors. I explored various data structures (vectors, hashtables, and binary search trees) and sought to understand their benefits and trade-offs in terms of runtime and memory usage. Grasping the concept of data structures is vital, as they serve as the basis for arranging, storing, and retrieving data effectively within a software application. Selecting the right data structure can significantly influence an application's performance and memory consumption. Various data structures possess distinct advantages and disadvantages, and opting for the most suitable one for a specific problem can result in a more optimized solution.

Working on this project has helped me understand how to break the problem down into smaller more manageable tasks. Segmenting the code into these components also helps in making the code more maintainable and easier to understand. A third thing I realized is that a robust program is built upon comprehensive and well put error handling and validation. This helps in creating software that is less prone to input failures.
